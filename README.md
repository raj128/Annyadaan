Problem Statement:
1. In many cities and communities, there is a significant amount of food waste that occurs every day.
2. At the same time, there are also many people who struggle to access healthy and nutritious food due to financial or logistical constraints.
3. This creates a disconnect between those who have excess food and those who need it.

Solution:
1. A potential solution is a food sharing application that connects donors with nearby organizations or individuals who could benefit from surplus food.
2. The application would facilitate the pickup and delivery of the donations, reducing food waste and addressing food insecurity.
3. This solution promotes sustainable food consumption.
