#Problem Statement
1>In many cities and communities, there is a significant
amount of food waste that occurs every day.
2>At the same time, there are also many people who
struggle to access healthy and nutritious food due to
financial or logistical constraints.
3>This creates a disconnect between those who have
excess food and those who need it.
#Solution
1>A potential solution is a food sharing application that
connects donors with nearby organizations or individuals who
could benefit from surplus food.
1>The application would facilitate the pickup and delivery of
the donations, reducing food waste and addressing food
insecurity.
3>This solution promotes sustainable food consumption
